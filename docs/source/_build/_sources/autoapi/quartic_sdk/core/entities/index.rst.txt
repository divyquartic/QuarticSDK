.. class:: Asset

   Bases: :class:`quartic_sdk.core.entities.base.Base`

   The given class refers to the asset entity which is created based upon the
   asset object returned from the API

   .. attribute:: mapping
      

      

   .. method:: __repr__(self)

      Override the method to return the asset name


   .. method:: get_tags(self, query_params={})

      The given method returns the list of tags for the given asset
      :param query_params: Dictionary of filter conditions


   .. method:: event_frames(self, query_params={})

      The given method returns the list of event frames for the given asset
      :param query_params: Dictionary of filter conditions


   .. method:: batches(self, query_params={})

      The given method returns the list of batches for the given asset
      :param query_params: Dictionary of filter conditions


   .. method:: data(self, start_time, stop_time, granularity=0, return_type=Constants.RETURN_PANDAS, batch_size=Constants.DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT_ROWS, transformations=[])

      Get the data of all tags in the asset between the given start_time and
      stop_time for the given granularity
      :param start_time: (epoch) Start_time for getting data
      :param stop_time: (epoch) Stop_time for getting data
      :param granularity: Granularity of the data
      :param return_type: The param decides whether the data after querying will be
          json(when value is "json") or pandas dataframe(when value is "pd"). By default,
          it takes the value as "json"
      :param transformations: Refers to the list of transformations. It supports either
          interpolation or aggregation, depending upon which, we pass the value of this
          dictionary. If `transformation_type` is "aggregation", an optional key can be
          passed called `aggregation_timestamp`, which determines how the timestamp information
          will be retained after aggregation. Valid options are "first", "last" or "discard". By
          default, the last timestamp in each group will be retained.
          An example value here is:
          [{
              "transformation_type": "interpolation",
