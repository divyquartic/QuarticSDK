GraphQL Client
===============

GraphQLClient
------------

Class refers to the GraphQLClient which is used as the interface between
the user querying the Quartic AI Platform and their use case.

This class has the following parameters for initialization:

-  **url (mandatory)**: Refers to the host URL the user connects to for
   making API calls.
-  **username (optional)**: Required for Basic Authentication.
-  **password (optional)**: Required for Basic Authentication.

The two methods are Basic Authentication and OAuth2.0:
*****************************************************

Basic Authentication:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user must pass the username and password along with the hostname in the GraphQLClient
to ensure the successive API calls are authenticated via Basic Authentication.

::

    client = GraphqlClient(host="https://test.quartic.ai", username="username", password="password")

OAuth2.0
~~~~~~~~

The user must pass the OAuth token along with the hostname to ensure that all the
successive API calls are authenticated via OAuth2.0. For detailed information on fetching
tokens, please refer to the Quartic Knowledge Base.

::

    client = GraphqlClient(url="https://test.quartic.ai", oauth_token="9865c994212e495690c2db3fc6cbdfea")

.data
~~~~~

This method is present only for the ``Tag`` type EntityList, and it
returns the data present in the given tags. It returns a TagDataIterator
instance, and has the following parameters:

-  **start\_time (mandatory)**: (epoch) Refers to the ``start_time`` for
   fetching the data of the asset.
-  **stop\_time (mandatory)**: (epoch) Refers to the ``stop_time`` for
   fetching the data of the asset.
-  **granularity (optional)**: This refers to the granularity at which
   data is required. If granularity is provided, the method returns the
   data in the tag for the given time range with the lower of the
   closest possible granularity: Raw (granularity of the datasource),
   5s, 30s, 60s, 300s, 1200s, 3600s, 10800s, 21600s, 43200s or 86400s.
   The default granularity is Raw.
-  **return\_type (optional)**: The user can pass either ``pd``, which
   will return the pandas dataframe iterator, or ``json`` which will
   return json object on return. This value takes the ``pd`` value as
   default.
-  **transformations (optional)**: The user must pass the list
   of interpolations and aggregations here. Further details on
   transformations is provided towards the end of this documentation.

TagDataIterator
------------------

Querying data for any set of tags in any given duration returns an
instance of ``TagDataIterator``, which can be used to iterate between
the given time range. When the ``.data`` of tags/assets is called, the
method divides the complete interval between ``start_time`` and
``stop_time`` into different time\_ranges, with each range containing up
to 200,000 data points for all the tags. The user can loop through this
interval to get all the data points.

HistoricalTagDataIterator
-------------------------

Querying historical data for any set of tags in any given duration returns
an instance of ``HistoricalTagDataIterator``, which can be used to iterate
between the given time range. When the ``.historical_data`` of data source
is called, the class queries via cursor, based upon the entered ``batch_size``

The available methods are as follows:
*************************************

.get_complete_data_in_range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method loops through the complete range and returns the final data frame
which is required. Note that this is meant to be used only for pandas return
of historical data and not for json return. The method has the following parameters:

-  **historical\_data\_iterator (mandatory)** This is the historicaldataiterator
   object whose complete data is to be returned

Transformations:
****************

The tag data iterator is created based upon the multiple transformations
that a user might need. The transformations is a list of dictionaries
where each dictionary contains the details of interpolation/aggregation
to be performed on the data. The different transformations are:

Interpolation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interpolation requires the following keys to be present:

-  **transformation\_type (mandatory)**: Refers to the type of
   transformation and must always be ``interpolation``.
-  **column (mandatory)**: Refers to the column which is to be
   interpolated.
-  **method (mandatory)**: Refers to the interpolation method; the
   options are: linear, spline, cubic interpolation, and polynomial.
-  **order (mandatory)**: Refers to the order of the interpolation, and
   is required for all methods except ``linear``.
-  **limit\_direction (optional)**: Refers to the direction in which the
   interpolation takes place. The default value is ``forward``.

Aggregation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aggregation requires the following keys to be present:

-  **transformation\_type (mandatory)**: Refers to the type of
   transformation and must always be ``aggregation``.
-  **aggregation\_column (mandatory)**: Refers to the column being
   aggregated.
-  **aggregation\_dict (mandatory)**: This dictionary refers to the
   methods on which the different columns in the dataset are to be
   aggregated.
